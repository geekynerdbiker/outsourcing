Dataset:

The attached dataset represents a list of prices across three years for certain products.
Those products are identified by their specifications such as product name, variety, grade, label,
region.

It will be used for the last question.


1. Calendar Problem
Language restriction: None -- Please write it in your most comfortable language

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31
Dec 2000)?


2. Base Converter
Language Requirement: Python

Implement the `_convert` method of the following class:
--

class Transformer(object):
"""Convert numbers from base 10 integers to base N strings and back again.
Sample usage:
>>> base20 = Transformer('0123456789abcdefghij')
>>> base20.from_decimal(1234)
'31e'
>>> base20.to_decimal('31e')
1234
"""
decimal_digits = '0123456789'
def __init__(self, digits):
self.digits = digits
def from_decimal(self, i):
return self._convert(i, self.decimal_digits, self.digits)
def to_decimal(self, s):
return int(self._convert(s, self.digits, self.decimal_digits))
def _convert(self, number, fromdigits, todigits):
raise NotImplementedError
binary_transformer = Transformer('01')
hex_transformer = Transformer('0123456789ABCDEF')
base62_transformer =
Transformer('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')

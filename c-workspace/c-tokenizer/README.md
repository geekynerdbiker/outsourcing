# A0: Word Count

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

1. **Write** a Makefile to compile a simple C program.
2. **Use** raw file I/O functions to open and read files.
3. **Create** a program that will parse file content for display.
4. **Use** memory allocator functions.

Specifications
--------------

For this assignment, you will complete a program that counts the number of words in a file. This is similar to the common Linux tool `wc` (word count). In fact, you can check that your program is functioning correctly by running `wc -w` on the provided input files.

### Buffering Your Own I/O

You must use raw file I/O for this assignment which means you will be filling a buffer of 1024 bytes using the `read()` system call and then parsing text out of that buffer. You should use `strsep()` to parse the text by space or newline character. This will result in a series of non-whitespace tokens that need to be saved in an **array of structs**. When you reach the end of this series of tokens, two things might happen:

1. The filled buffer ends on a word boundary ðŸ˜€ **OR**
2. The filled buffer ends in the middle of a word ðŸ˜•

Because this may happen, **you cannot trust the final token in the buffer to be complete**. You must move the (potentially) partial token to the front of the buffer and then fill the buffer starting from where that token ends (so the information is not overwritten). **This is very difficult to get correct**, and if you do not, the resulting word count will not be correct.

Many functions in the C stdlib return values **that are important, do not ignore them**.

### Array of Structs

We need a data structure where each word is associated with its count. This is a good opportunity to use an **array of structs** where the struct is a data structure that consists of the word and the number of times it occurs in the file. This has already been defined for you and given the type name `WORD_T`. An array of these elements is declared as `words` and the size of that array is being tracked with `total_words`. When you encounter a word from the file (complete token), you need to perform a linear search of the array to see if that word has already been enounctered:

1. If it has, you simply increment the `.count` field from the struct.
2. If this is the first time the word has been countered, you must **resize the array** (using `realloc()`) and add the word and the count of 1 to the end of the array.

Since the `word` field in the struct is an array of 42 characters, you can copy the characters from the token to the field using `strcpy()`. Don't forget a _null-terminator_, though.

### Restrictions

* You must compile your program using the flags `std=gnu11`, `-Werror` and `-Wall`.
* You may not write functions or code outside of the locations indicated with `TODO`s (line 29, lines 32-45, line 48).
* You may not use any file stream functions such as `fopen()`, `fread()` or `fclose()`. If you are unsure if a C stdlib function is banned, please just ask.
* You may not `lseek()` or reposition the file pointer (other than by calling `read()`).
* You may not close and reopen the file, you should only need to open it once and read through it a single time.
* You may not use a buffer size other than 1024 bytes.

### Submission

Submit only your completed `wc.c` file and associated `Makefile`. When `make` is executed in the directory, a binary named `wc` should be created. If not, the autograder will fail. You can make a submission as many times as you'd like in order to see the autograder feedback. The maximum points you can receive from the autograder is 8. This is the **Functional** category of the rubric.

### Functions

Here is a list of functions that are used by the solution program. This might help in completing the assignment.

*    `close()`
*    `comparator()`
*    `free()`
*    `lfind()`
*    `memmove()`
*    `open()`
*    `print_and_free()`
*    `printf()`
*    `read()`
*    `realloc()`
*    `strcmp()`
*    `strlen()`
*    `strncpy()`
*    `strsep()`

Example
-------

Here's a sample interaction with a working program. **Your program must not print out anything other than what's shown or the autograder will fail**. The `$` character represents the terminal prompt, you do not type this character when executing commands.

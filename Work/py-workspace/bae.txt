BOB.
Hi!

ALICE. 
Hello! How are you?

BOB.
I'm doing well, thanks! 
Have you seen my coin?

ALICE. 
Yes, I gave it to Eve. 
Eve, do you remember that coin?

EVE.
The golden one?

ALICE.
Yes

EVE.
What about it?

ALICE.
Do you still have it?

EVE.
Maybe. But, if I did, I would not return it to you.
